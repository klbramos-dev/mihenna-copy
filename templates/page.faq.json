Because henna is a dye that absorbs into your skin cells, the faster you lose skin cells, the faster your henna stain will disappear. We’ve got some tips to make it last.<\/p><ul><li>Before you get your henna paste applied, exfoliate. Get off as much dead skin from the area as you can.<\/li><li>Wash the area to remove your natural oils, and then fully dry your skin.<\/li><li>Avoid water for the first few hours. Don’t jump in the shower right after you get your tattoo.<\/li><li>After you have your gorgeous henna, do not exfoliate! Your dead skin cells will naturally fall off, but try to avoid encouraging them.<\/li><li>Moisturize the area to keep your skin healthier for longer. We recommend using coconut oil to keep the area luscious.<\/li><\/ul>"

            "question": "What henna is safe?",
            "answer": "<p>This frequently asked question is more complex than it seems due to misconceptions about henna. Let’s break it down into a few different areas - pure henna, brown henna paste, and black henna.<\/p><ul><li>Pure henna a dye is made from the leaves of the Lawsonia inermis plant. The leaves are dried and crushed into a powder. The henna plant has a very low potential for skin allergies, according to the Dermatology Online Journal. However, this powder alone isn’t going to stick to your skin or create beautiful designs.<\/li><li>Brown henna paste is made by mixing the powder with at least one type of liquid in order to make it adhere to your skin. Most reactions are due to these additional ingredients. It’s important to read the ingredients and test the henna paste in a small area if you have sensitive skin.<\/li><li>Black henna is a misnomer and does not actually contain any powder from the Lawsonia inermis plant. It often contains p-phenylenediamine (PPD), also known as coal tar. PPD is considered a contact allergen and has a long list of symptoms you can read more about on DermNet. Black henna is not common in the US, Canada, or the UK, but it can be found abroad. Be sure to only get henna tattoos when the paste is brown or reddish-brown, earthy color.<\/li><\/ul><p>At Mihenna, our organic henna paste is made from fresh distilled water, eucalyptus oil, tea tree oil, and sugar. While it is unlikely that the majority of people would have any skin reaction, please test on a small patch if you have frequent skin sensitivity or irritation.<\/p><p>But even natural henna paste should not be consumed. If you, your child, or your pet ingests henna paste, you will likely have an upset stomach and experience diuretic effects.<\/p>"

Cultures in Africa - especially Morocco, the Middle East, Pakistan, and India all developed uses for this plant. From medicines made out of the roots to dye for hair and skin made out of the dried, powdered leaves, Lawsonia inermis rose in popularity. Different traditions developed in these regions, but almost everyone ended up using the dye to stain designs on their hands and feet. Henna tattoos have distinct motifs based on where they originated. Read more about the history of henna in our previous posts.<\/p>"

If after 24 hours your henna freckles are not showing, we recommend thoroughly exfoliating, washing, and drying your face to remove all oils and makeup. In an air conditioned room, allow the henna to stay on your face for longer (up to 12 hours). Do not apply water to your face for 4 - 5 hours after removing the henna. Regularly moisturize to help the stains last longer.<\/p>"

Allow the paste to dry for 2 to 12 hours, depending on how dark you want your fake freckles to be. Use coconut oil to remove the dried henna paste and simultaneously moisturize your skin.
